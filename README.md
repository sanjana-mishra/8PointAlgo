# 8PointAlgo
Using epipolar geometry to find the structure of a 3D scene given only two images of different views of the scene.

The fundamental matrix is a key concept in computer vision, used to describe the relationship between two views of the same scene, typically from different cameras. One common way to compute the fundamental matrix is using the 8-point algorithm, which involves finding a set of correspondences between points in the two views and then solving for the fundamental matrix using linear algebra. Both SIFT and RANSAC implementations have been made.
